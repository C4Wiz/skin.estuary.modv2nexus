# Skin Estuary MOD V2 for KODI 20 Nexus KN Edition Modified by C4Wiz #

**Some screenshots You'll find at the end of this Readme**

## Installation Notes ##

The "Kodinerds Repo", Must be installed manually so the required PVR Artwork Module (If you use the PVR Function) can be installed, and other usefull addons from the Kodi Nerds Repo.

Kodi Nerds Repo is available from my repo. Additional Addon's can be used by Installing the "Rector Stuff Repo"

Non Installable Addon's will be hidden in SkinSettings till the Repos are Installed.

### File name flagging ###
If you want to use special flags like HDR or Dolby Vision or special 3D formats you have to name your files with proper tags, 
preferably before the file extension: 

| 3D with <br> stereoscopic detection |           MVC codec            |          Side by Side          |         Top and Bottom         |         HDR10 Files          |            HDR10+ Files          |             Dolby Vision             |
|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|

|             no tagging              |             3d.mvc             |             3d.sbs             |             3d.tab             |           .hdr10.            |              .hdr10+.            |     .dv., .dovi., .dolbyvision.      |



### Animated Artwork ###

As the setup of animated artwork was done by skinhelper addon (which was removed from skin) the addon "Animated Artwork Module" has now taken 
the management of those artwork. Animated artwork has some limitations (see Kodi Wiki: https://kodi.wiki/view/Artwork_types#Animated_Artwork). 
To get this feature work properly, you have to assign a folder within the addon settings, which contains all the artwork. This 
folder **must** be a folder of your local filesystem. You can use network share, but this **must** be mounted to a local mountpoint.
Put all your artwork into this folder. Subfolders are allowed (without nesting).  

If you navigate in your movie library, you'll have a new entry now to (re)assign animated Artwork in the context menu. The skin
supports animated poster only.
